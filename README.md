# Computer Vision Repository

This repository contains a Python script and some images for computer vision tasks.

## `images.py`
The `images.py` script uses the OpenCV library to load and display an image. The script reads an image from the `Images` folder and displays it in a pop-up window.

## Images
The `Images` folder contains sample images used by the `images.py` script. These are standard images that can be replaced with any images for testing the script.
