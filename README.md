# Computer Vision Repository

This repository contains a Python script and some images for computer vision tasks.

## `images.py`
The `images.py` script uses the OpenCV library to load and display an image. The script reads an image from the `Images` folder and displays it in a pop-up window.

## Images
The `Images` folder contains sample images used by the `images.py` script. These are standard images that can be replaced with any images for testing the script.

### What the script does:
1. It reads two images from the `Images` folder.
2. It displays each image in separate pop-up windows.
3. The script waits for the user to press a key to close the windows.

### How to run the script:
- Ensure you have the OpenCV library installed. You can install it using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python

- Once library requiremnt is fulfilled, go to `Files` and run following command:
  ```bash
  python images.py
